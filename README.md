## About BMI
Body Mass Index (BMI) is simplyÂ a guideline for tracking weight problems. It is a weight-based measurement of body fat. Female and male BMI calculations would differ. BMI is the amount of fat in the body in relation to height and weight. This is a method of determining a person's fat content and muscle mass in order to determine whether they are healthy or prone to health issues such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or even certain types of cancer.
